This blog series will document the experiences of building a rugby focused website that enables users to:

    - browse historical rugby results
    - search for statistics related to a specific game 
    - visualize and analyse team performance
    - sign up to receive result notifications for their favourite team
    - Predict team performance in an upcoming match based on historical results

The reason for choosing rugby as an area of focus is simply because I love watching rugby so it makes it a natural product candidate for me!

Accompanying the build out of product features will be a easy to follow step-by-step guide on getting the environment up and running.

So, let's get going then. Click <a href="https://timosullivan.org/deploying-web-server-locally/">deploying web server locally</a>  to move to the first stage of getting our rugby site up and running.

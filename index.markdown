  <h1>Hi, I’m Tim O’Sullivan 👋</h1>
  <p>I build apps that make everyday life <strong>simpler, more efficient, and more enjoyable</strong>. For me, technology isn’t just about features—it’s about solving real problems and making life feel a little easier.</p>
  <p>Every time I hear that one of my apps has helped someone save time, reduce stress, or just made their day a bit smoother, it reminds me why I do what I do. That’s what drives me to keep creating and improving.</p>

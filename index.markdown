# Hi, I’m Tim O'Sullivan 👋

I build apps that make everyday life **simpler, more efficient, and more enjoyable**. For me, technology isn’t just about features—it’s about solving real problems and making life feel a little easier.

Every time I hear that one of my apps has helped someone save time, reduce stress, or just made their day a bit smoother, it reminds me why I do what I do. That’s what drives me to keep creating and improving.
